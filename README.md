# Dungeons and Kittens

Dungeons and Kittens is aimed at RPG/Dungeon Crawler lovers. In this text based adventure you play as a kitten who has been overthrown and kicked out of their kingdom. You have the ability to check out the armoury and regain strength, or get straight into the dungeon to level up. The final boss is in the castle. This game is very grindy, and can be very addictive.

## Features 
The main features are the neverending dungeon and bossfight within the castle.
### Existing Features

- __The Dungeon of Neverending Torment__

  - The Dungeon of Neverending Torment, this is an endless dungeon inspired by idle games found on mobile devices. This is an infinite way for the player to gain strength and progress the story at level 10 by obtaining the required item.


- __The armoury__

  - The armoury allows the player to "purchase" weapons, each weapon is completely randomized with different names each time, and then when bought added to the player's inventory, using this weapon makes the stronger in the dungeon and the castle.


- __The Castle__

  - The castle is the end boss fight, with a long bossfight based around the same "idle" inspiration as the dungeon.


Additional features that I would implement would be:
 - Different types of damage
 - A tavern with the ability to recruit people to the party
 - A much more indepth combat system

### Features Left to Implement

- Colourful Items, with different qualities of item, such as Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary, Mythic.
- More customisation for character
- Body armour

## Testing 

In regards to testing, having people try the game, and play the game thoroughly was the biggest form of testing. As was the ability to jump between the levels within the game by editing the code, and making sure everything worked as intended.
